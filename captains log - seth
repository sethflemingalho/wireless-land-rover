  learning how to use raspberry pi. Connecting through SSH to pie. New pi has difficultyy loading lxsession - no icons appear 
  - arduino: stk500_recv(): programmer is not responding, fixed. needed new cable.

  desinging prototype chassi on autocad.
  
2015-10-05 - 2015-11-01
  complete plans for rover,
  *runs from both raspberry pi and arduino connected by usb
  *prototype made from vex, final copy machined from aluminum
  *two separate power souces one for intelligence and one for the motors
  * four motors tank steering
  * BME280 for temp/pressure/humidity/altitude
  *adafruits animometre for windspeed
  *raspberry pi connected through wifi to laptop using putty
  *arduino runs animometre and potentially the motors
  *raspberry pi runs BME280 and the arduino and the wifi connection plus data transfering to the laptop

  coding animometre - must find voltage output and convert it to m/s wind speed
  * 0.4v = 0m/s and 2.0v = 36.5m/s

  connecting raspberry pi to laptop
  *connect pi to laptop with eathernet cable
  *scan ip with laptop (range= between 192.168.137.1 - 192.168.137.200)
  *get pi's ip
  *open putty insert pi's ip and open (if you want to see the pi's screen and not just the terminal launch xming and in the pi open ssh and enable forwarding)
  *loginto pi username = pi password = raspberry
  *cd Desktop/
  *mkdir rover (already done)
  *nano test.py (open editor)
  *to test code - sudo python test.py
  *probleme- when finding laptops ip use ipconfig in comand prompt but make sure you use the ipv4 adress

  mounting usb drive to raspberry pi
  - type tail -f/var/logmessages
  on one line look for something like sdal, sdbl, sda2 etc
  that measn the device is located in /dev/sdal
  create directory under /media so you can mount the drive
 - sudo mkdir /media/usbstick
  then mount the usb
- sudo mount -t vfat -o uid=pi,gid=pi /dev/sdal /media/usbstick/
then look at drive
cd /media/usbstick/
ls ~/
sudo umount /media/usbstick

testing BME280 with arduino,
set code to line 32
Adafruit_BME280 bme(BME_CS, BME_....

installing Arduino on the pi 
sudo apt-get install arduino
  
2015-11-23
got motors working with relay shield, 
*delay must be set over 1200milliseconds or the relay will have difficulty connecting
arduino has problmes having code uploaded to it throught the pi - reason unknown

enable camera
raspistill -o cam_test.jpg to take pic
